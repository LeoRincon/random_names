# random_names

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g default_name
```

# Usage

```bash
default_name
```

# Contributing

If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [default_name](https://github.com/LeoRincon/random_names)
